# The camera attributes can be viewed by using the command
  udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/video0) 
# while the camera is attached
# Once a unique attribute has been identified for each camera,
# edit or create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-local.rules.
# Assuming that the unique attribute for the camera was ATTR{algo}=="algún_valor_que_no_tenga_otra"
# you would add the following line to the 99-local.rules file: 
  KERNEL=="video[0-9]*", ATTR{algo}=="algún_valor_que_no_tenga_otra", SYMLINK+="NombreExplicito"
# Once the change has been made and saved, reboot the computer and
# there should now be a "sticky" device called /dev/NombreExplicito
